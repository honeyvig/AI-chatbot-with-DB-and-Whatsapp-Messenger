==============
To build an AI-based chatbot that integrates with both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, you'll need to utilize several APIs, libraries, and frameworks. Below is an outline of how you can implement such a system, and I will provide sample Python code to get you started on key aspects like chatbot development, natural language processing, and integration with both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
Project Components:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): For understanding and processing user queries.
    Chatbot Framework: Framework to build and deploy the chatbot.
    Integration with WhatsApp & Facebook Messenger: For communication with users on these platforms.
    Payment Links & Menu: For allowing users to order services and access weblinks.

We'll break down the solution into the following components:

    Using NLP for Handling User Queries.
    Building a Chatbot using a Framework.
    Integrating the Chatbot with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
    Creating a Multi-option Menu.

Step 1: Setting Up Natural Language Processing (NLP)

For the chatbot to understand and process natural language, you can use a pre-trained model from spaCy, transformers, or you can use the Rasa framework for more advanced NLP handling.

In this example, I'll use the transformers library from Hugging Face to integrate a pre-trained model for handling text-based queries.

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install transformers
pip install torch

Here's the Python code to initialize the NLP model and use it to process incoming messages:

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained conversational model
nlp = pipeline("conversational", model="facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill")

# Function to process user input and return chatbot response
def get_chatbot_response(user_message):
    response = nlp(user_message)
    return response[0]['generated_text']

# Example interaction
user_input = "Tell me about your services."
chatbot_reply = get_chatbot_response(user_input)
print(chatbot_reply)

This code uses BlenderBot, a conversational AI model, for natural language understanding and response generation.
Step 2: Building the Chatbot Logic

To handle specific actions like ordering services and navigating through menus, you can define a chatbot class with different intents (i.e., specific actions the bot should handle).

Here’s a simple example of a bot class that processes user queries:

class ServiceChatBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = ["Service 1", "Service 2", "Service 3"]
        self.payment_link = "https://payment.example.com"
        self.weblinks = {
            "service_info": "https://www.example.com/services",
            "faq": "https://www.example.com/faq"
        }

    def handle_query(self, user_message):
        # Process user input to determine intent
        user_message = user_message.lower()

        if "order" in user_message:
            return self.show_service_menu()
        elif "info" in user_message:
            return self.show_info_links()
        elif "payment" in user_message:
            return f"Click here to complete the payment: {self.payment_link}"
        else:
            return "I didn't understand that. Please select one of the options: \n1. Order a service\n2. Get service information\n3. Payment"

    def show_service_menu(self):
        services_list = "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {service}" for i, service in enumerate(self.services)])
        return f"Please choose a service to order:\n{services_list}"

    def show_info_links(self):
        info_message = "You can find more information here:\n"
        for name, link in self.weblinks.items():
            info_message += f"{name.capitalize()}: {link}\n"
        return info_message

# Create an instance of the bot
chatbot = ServiceChatBot()

# Example of interaction
user_input = "Tell me about your services."
response = chatbot.handle_query(user_input)
print(response)

Step 3: Integrating with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger

For the integration with WhatsApp, you can use the Twilio API, and for Facebook Messenger, you can use Facebook's Messenger Platform API. Below is an overview of how to set this up.
WhatsApp Integration with Twilio API

To send and receive messages on WhatsApp using Twilio, follow these steps:

    Sign Up for a Twilio account and set up a WhatsApp sandbox.
    Install Twilio SDK:

pip install twilio

    Use the following code to send and receive messages on WhatsApp:

from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio credentials (replace with your actual credentials)
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
from_whatsapp_number = 'whatsapp:+14155238886'  # Twilio Sandbox WhatsApp number
to_whatsapp_number = 'whatsapp:+1234567890'  # Your personal WhatsApp number

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# Send message
message = client.messages.create(
    body="Hello! How can I help you today?",
    from_=from_whatsapp_number,
    to=to_whatsapp_number
)

print(f"Message sent: {message.sid}")

For receiving messages, set up a webhook endpoint (using Flask or Django) to process incoming messages and send appropriate responses.
Facebook Messenger Integration

For Facebook Messenger, you need to set up a Facebook App and configure the Messenger Platform API.

    Create a Facebook App.
    Set up the Messenger Webhook to receive messages.
    Install flask or django to build the API for the webhook.

Here’s an example of a basic Flask app to handle Facebook Messenger Webhook:

pip install flask

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# Verify Facebook Messenger Webhook
@app.route("/webhook", methods=["GET"])
def verify_webhook():
    # Facebook requires a challenge token to verify the webhook
    if request.args.get("hub.mode") == "subscribe" and request.args.get("hub.verify_token") == "your_verify_token":
        return request.args["hub.challenge"], 200
    return "Verification failed", 403

# Handle incoming messages
@app.route("/webhook", methods=["POST"])
def handle_message():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Extract user message
    user_message = data['entry'][0]['messaging'][0]['message']['text']

    # Create a response based on the query
    response_message = chatbot.handle_query(user_message)

    # Send response back to the user
    recipient_id = data['entry'][0]['messaging'][0]['sender']['id']
    send_message(recipient_id, response_message)

    return "OK", 200

# Function to send a response message back to Facebook Messenger
def send_message(recipient_id, message_text):
    access_token = 'your_facebook_page_access_token'
    url = f"https://graph.facebook.com/v12.0/me/messages?access_token={access_token}"
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    payload = {
        "recipient": {"id": recipient_id},
        "message": {"text": message_text}
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    print("Message sent:", response.status_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)

This Flask app listens for messages sent via Facebook Messenger, processes them with the chatbot, and sends a response back to the user.
Step 4: Payment Links Integration

You can integrate payment links by generating URLs for different services and sending them back to the user. This was already shown in the handle_query() function above where payment links are dynamically provided to users.
Final Steps

    Test the Chatbot: Test the chatbot extensively with sample queries and ensure that the integration with both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger is working smoothly.
    Deploy: Host the chatbot using a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability and reliability.

Conclusion

This Python code gives a comprehensive framework for creating an AI-based chatbot that can be integrated with both WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, handling service queries, providing information, and processing payments. The bot uses NLP for accurate responses and can interact with users via messaging platforms. Be sure to customize the message flows, integrate more sophisticated NLP models, and handle various edge cases for optimal user experience.
